# Example MkDocs site

This is an examke MkDocs site deployed on GitHub pages. It is rendered under [this link](https://k-cybulski.github.io/mkdocs-example/).

It uses the [GitHub MkDocs deploy
action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-mkdocs). To launch it, I clicked `Use this template` on [this example template](https://github.com/mhausenblas/mkdocs-template). Then, I went into the repository `Settings` -> `Options` -> `GitHub Pages` and set the `Source` to be the `gh-pages` branch.
